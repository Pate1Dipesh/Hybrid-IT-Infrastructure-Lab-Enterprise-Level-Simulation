Hybrid IT Infrastructure Simulation

This project simulates a comprehensive enterprise IT infrastructure, designed to replicate a real-world hybrid environment typically found in large multinational corporations. It integrates cloud-based solutions like Microsoft 365, Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Exchange Online, and Intune with on-premises technologies such as Active Directory and Group Policy, creating a secure and scalable IT ecosystem. The project covers the entire lifecycle of IT management, from user authentication and device provisioning with Windows Autopilot to securing endpoints with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. It also includes the setup of critical enterprise services like email, file sharing, and VPN access, along with cloud-based virtual desktops through Windows 365 Cloud PCs. Security is a core focus, with enforced baselines and policies applied via GPOs and Intune, alongside advanced protections like BitLocker encryption and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The project also integrates a helpdesk solution, osTicket, for efficient IT support and ticket management. By combining modern cloud practices with traditional on-premises technologies, this simulation offers hands-on experience in building and managing an enterprise-grade IT infrastructure, preparing you for real-world scenarios in IT management, cloud services, and endpoint security.
