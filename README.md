Hybrid IT Infrastructure Simulation

This project simulates a real-world hybrid enterprise IT infrastructure, integrating Microsoft 365, Entra ID, Exchange Online, and Intune with on-premises solutions like Active Directory and Group Policy. It covers key areas such as device provisioning with Windows Autopilot, endpoint security with Microsoft Defender, and email infrastructure through Exchange Online. The setup includes security baselines, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), VPN access, and a helpdesk solution using osTicket. Combining cloud and on-premises technologies, this project provides hands-on experience in managing modern IT environments, preparing you for real-world IT management, cloud integration, and security practices in enterprise settings.
